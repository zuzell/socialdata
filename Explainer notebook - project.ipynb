The original datasets can be found in this webpage:\nhttps://www.opendata.dk/city-of-copenhagen/faste-cykeltaellinger\n\nAs foreigners living in Denmark we were really suprised by the danish biking culture and number of bikes we saw on the streets of Copenhagen. We wanted to get better understanding of number of people using bikes, when are the bike rush hours and if data confirms our observation of Danish people biking regardless bad weather.\n\n\nOur aim was to familiarise readers with Danish cycling culture and show interesting facts about cycling in Copenhagen. The article gives an insight into cycling patterns, when and where people cycle, and how the weather affects cycling.\n\n","metadata":{"cell_id":"2e3efac5b4e94f879e3b1339e5dc23dc","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\nimport calendar\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport folium\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport math","metadata":{"cell_id":"a2e73cb3bebe4709a436225c3df46284","source_hash":"b385abd5","execution_start":1683822653457,"execution_millis":3619,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Basic stats.
